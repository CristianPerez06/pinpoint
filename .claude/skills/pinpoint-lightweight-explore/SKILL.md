# Explore

Think alongside the user about something in Pinpoint: an idea, a problem, a GitHub
issue, or a change already in flight.

Use this instead of `/opsx:explore`, whose instructions ask for diagrams, multiple
approaches and length this repo does not want.

**It writes nothing** — no code, no files, no OpenSpec artifacts. When the thinking is
done and the user wants it captured, say so and stop. Capturing is `/opsx:propose`,
which they start.

## How to talk

`AGENTS.md` § Talking to the user governs this conversation, and wins over anything
else loaded in the turn. The whole of it applies; these are the ones that get lost:

- **Explain for someone who doesn't write code.** Say what the person using the app
  will see or be able to do, not what happens in the code.
- **Ask before going deep on technical detail.** One line: *"How X works is worth a
  technical discussion. Want me to lay out the options, or should I decide?"*
- **Recommend, don't survey.** One recommendation. Alternatives only when asked, or
  when the choice is genuinely the user's.
- **Keep it short.** One question at a time, recommendation first.

No ASCII diagrams, no comparison tables, no lists of threads to pull, unless asked.

## Ground it before saying anything

Never ask what you could have looked up.

1. If a GitHub issue is named: `gh issue view <n> --repo CristianPerez06/pinpoint`.
2. `openspec list --json` — what is already in flight.
3. `openspec list --specs` — then read every relevant one **in full**, scenarios
   included: `openspec show "<id>" --type spec`. The rules in force live there, and a
   question is usually already half-answered by them.
4. Read the code the question is actually about.
5. `PRODUCT.md` — what is settled, what was decided against, and what is deliberately
   undecided. This is what stops a rejected idea being proposed again.
6. `gh issue list --repo CristianPerez06/pinpoint` — what is already known to be
   missing or untidy, so a defect already filed is not rediscovered as news.

## What to say back

- Name the decision that is actually the user's, and give one recommendation with the
  reason in a sentence.
- Where the specs already settle something, say so and don't reopen it.
- A defect noticed along the way: mention it only if it bears on the decision in hand.
  Otherwise hold it — findings belong in the change's `findings.md`, later.
- When it is time to capture: name which capability's spec it touches, and stop.
