/**
 * Fail if the OpenSpec-generated agent instructions are not exactly the five
 * workflows this repository keeps.
 *
 * Why this exists: which workflows OpenSpec generates is a machine-level
 * setting, not a repository one. It lives in the global config, its default
 * `core` profile includes `explore`, and `openspec update` rewrites every
 * generated file from whatever that machine happens to say. So the decision to
 * drop the generated `explore` — its text is kept word for word as a skill this
 * repository owns, `/pinpoint-deep-explore`, so it runs only when typed by name
 * and no update rewrites it; the everyday `/pinpoint-lightweight-explore` follows
 * AGENTS.md § Talking to the user — cannot be recorded in the repository by
 * deleting the file. It is undone by the next update, on any machine, with
 * nothing in the diff that looks wrong.
 *
 * The rule is stated as the whole set rather than as a ban on `explore`: the
 * generated workflows must be these five, no more and no fewer. A ban would be
 * blind to a sixth workflow nobody asked for; the set is not.
 *
 * It reads the working tree, not the index, so it fails the moment the files
 * appear — before they are staged, and whether or not they are ignored.
 *
 * No dependencies on purpose: this must run before anything is installed.
